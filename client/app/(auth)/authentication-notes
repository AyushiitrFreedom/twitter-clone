Authentication compramises of two things 
1. identity (authentication) -->  who the user is 
2. access (autherization) --> what can this user do

it has 3 places 
1. client side authenticaiton 
2. server side authentication
3. API routes authentication

if your app does not need to persist user data than you can go with youtube Github else you will have to use a database

there is a session object which comes with next auth , by using it you can check if the user is logged in or not , also you can get user name , email and other stuff from it , but you have to use provider in the top layer layout
